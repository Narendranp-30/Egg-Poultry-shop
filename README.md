Currently the poultry farm industry mainly uses the ledgers based system and manual entry for each transaction required, record of eggs, quantity of birds as well as sales and expense record is calculated on separate ledgers. Production percentage is calculated manually for every day production. Feed consumption per day or month is first written and them total is calculated.
